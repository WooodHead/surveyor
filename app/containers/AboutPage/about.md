# About Surveyor

Welcome! Through mobile apps, online maps, and serendipity, we discover new things in our geography everyday. At NYPL, we're inviting you to discover our collections through the lens of geography and, in the process, allow others to discover geographically as well! How? NYPL Surveyor is an experiment in geotagging NYPL's Digital Collections. We've built an interactive interface for viewing and locating items from our rich collections. With each contribution, you're creating new knowledge around the Library's collections.

This is a pilot experiment. As we receive the initial wave of submissions, we will be analyzing these contributions to build out quality control mechanisms and a map interface for discovering geotagged collections. We’ve started with just a few collections:  

* [The Eno collection of New York City views](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/the-eno-collection-of-new-york-city-views#/?tab=about)  
* [Changing New York](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/changing-new-york#/?tab=about)  
* [Album of photographs depicting the construction of the Broadway line, New York City Subway.](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/album-of-photographs-depicting-the-construction-of-the-broadway-line-new-york#/?tab=about)  
* [Album of photographs showing construction of the cable road on Broadway, New York City, in 1891.](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/album-of-photographs-showing-construction-of-the-cable-road-on-broadway-new-york#/?tab=about)  
* [Pictorial Description of Broadway](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/pictorial-description-of-broadway#/?tab=about)  
* [Fifth Avenue, New York, from start to finish](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/fifth-avenue-new-york-from-start-to-finish#/?tab=about)  

NYPL Surveyor is an [NYC Space/Time project](http://spacetime.nypl.org/) a major civic initiative aimed at turning historical maps and other geographic sources into a digital time-travel service for New York City. Sign up for our mailing list to receive updates about the Space/Time Initiative and NYPL Surveyor, including the launch of our map interface.

## Rules & Guidance
There are two guiding principles of geotagging in NYPL Surveyor **Take your best guess** and remembering **it’s okay to skip**! With geotagger, we’re starting from scratch. So take your best guess, because even getting an item in the right time zone is helpful! Remember, it’s okay to skip items. This project is a shared effort and if you don’t recognize a location, others might.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How should you deal with “View From” shots?
Sometimes prints and photographs will be of the “A View From” type shots. Meaning, it’s a wide view from a particular point in the city. How for instance, should you tag the following?   

![The south prospect of the city of New York, in North America](http://images.nypl.org/index.php?id=53913&t=w)

For these images place the marker in the approximate middle of the view. Surveyor has a second, optional step, allowing you to mark the full width of the image and the place where the images point of view. You can use this second step to more accurately tag these wide images.  

### How do I geotag an item with multiple locations?

Some items contain multiple locations. For instance, this item from [Views of NYC](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47dc-a06f-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99) contains three unique photos.

![Bronx: 3rd Avenue - 135th Street](http://images.nypl.org/index.php?id=700001F&t=w)

For items with multiple locations, simple select one item and geotag it. Remember, we’re asking multiple people to tag each item and we’ll be able to programmatically recognize when two locations are being tagged.  

### How to handle low res images?

If an image is low resolution and difficult to view, try viewing the item in our Digital Collections, where higher resolution versions of the image are available. Each item will have an easy link to their Digital Collections page.  

### Historic addresses! How do I handle them?

As history buffs and others know, New York City’s addresses aren't  static through time. Since street names change and numerical addresses have been reassigned throughout the years. Mapping historic resources is one of the big picture challenges we’re tackling with the Space/Time project. We’re working to programmatically address how we link historic resources. Pin the item based on where it would have stood, rather than the street address.

### How do I tag an item when the buildings don’t exist anymore?

Tag items on the contemporary map, where they would have stood when they existed. For instance, this lantern slide of the Crystal Palace should be pinned to the area which is now Bryant Park.
