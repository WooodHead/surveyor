### Help The New York Public Library put NYC history on the map!

You'll be presented with an item from the Library's digitized collections, use clues in the item's metadata and the image itself to locate on a map of New York City. Some you might recognize instantly while others can require a bit of investigation. Visit the item in our [Digital Collections](digitalcollections.nypl.org) for more clues and to view the image in high resolution. Use outside resources like [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) and [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7520018,-73.9834879,15.5z) to scout out the location.

Click submit once you've identified the item's location and you'll have the optional step of marking the direction and angle of the view. Not sure about the location or want a different challenge? It's always okay to skip!
