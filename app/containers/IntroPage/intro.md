Help The New York Public Library put NYC history on the map!

You'll be presented with an item from the Library's digitized collections.

Use clues in the item's metadata and the image itself to locate on a map of New York City. You might recognize some instantly while others can require a bit of investigation. Visit the item in our Digital Collections for more clues and to view the image in high resolution.

Once you've identified the item's location, hit submit and we'll show you a new image! Not sure about the location or want a different challenge? It's always okay to skip!

After you pin an item on the map, you'll have the optional step of marking the direction and angle of the view.
